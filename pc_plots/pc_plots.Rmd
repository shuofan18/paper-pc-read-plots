abstract: |
  Residuals plots are a primary means to diagnose statistical models. It requires human evaluation to determine if the structure in the plot is consistent with a random variation or not. If not, then the diagnosis is that the model has not adequately captured the relationships between response and explanatory variable in the data. This thesis develops a computer vision model to read residual plots. It compares results with a large database of human evaluations. The evaluations were conducted using a protocol called the "lineup" which places residual plots in a formal framework for statistical hypothesis testing. The comparison between computer and human is made on a very restricted and controlled set of residual plot structures. A new small human subject study is also conducted to compare human vs. computer in reading heteroscedasticity.

# Introduction

"The multiple regression model for cross-sectional data is still the most widely used vehicle for empirical analysis in economics and other social sciences" [@IE17]. Detecting possible violations of the Gauss-Markov assumptions is crucial to interpreting the data properly, especially in the early stage of analysis.[@zeileis2002] There are several distribution tests that are commonly used, for instance, the Pearson correlation test for detecting linear relationship; the Breusch-Pagan test and White test for investigating heteroskedasticity. But primarily residual plots are the main diagnostic tool and these rely on human evaluation. Because data plots show a lot more information than a single statistic. A good example here would be Anscombe's Quartet. "It is a set of four distinct data sets each consisting of 11 (x,y) pairs where each dataset produces the same summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, and correlation) while producing vastly different plots" [@ANS73]. Matejka and Fitzmaurice also did an interesting study on this issue, they used 'datasaurus' data from @DS16 and generated a series of data with same statistics but very different plots as shown in figure \ref{fig:saurus}. [@JM17]

```{r saurus, fig.width=6, fig.height=7, fig.cap="Each dataset has the same summary statistics to two decimal places: (E(x)=54.26, E(y)=47.83, Pearsonâ€™s r=, sd(x)=16.76, sd(y)=26.93"}

Section 2 compares computer performance against the database of human evaluation in reading linear relationship. Steps of constructing computer experiment are discussed, Turk study is explained, the comparison results are given. Chapter 3 compares computer performance against the results from the new human subject study. Details of this new human subject study are provided. A white-test [@white] for testing heteroskedasticity is introduced. The comparing results between the human, the computer and the white test are presented. Chapter 4 contains a short summary and some discussion regarding the future study.

\section{Experimental Methods}
\label{sec:experiment}

Former studies have shown that human eyes are sensitive to the systematic patterns in data plots. With proper manipulation, visualized plots can be used as test statistics and perform a valid hypothesis test. One example of these protocols that provides inferential validity is called "lineup" which is introduced by @HW10. "The protocol consists of generating 19 null plots (could be other numbers), inserting the plot of the real data in a random location among the null plots and asking the human viewer to single out one of the 20 plots as most different from the others" [@HW10]. If the real plot is chosen, it means the real data is likely to be different from the null hypothesis, so we reject the null hypothesis with 5% chance to be wrong (Type I error). Because if all 20 plots are generated from the null distribution, the chance of one plot being picked is $1/20$ which is 5%. With the assistance of "lineup", we avoid falling into the trap of apophenia where we see patterns in random noise. This protocol has proved to be valid and powerful theoretically as well as practically through human experiments, especially when the assumptions for doing conventional tests are violated [@MM13]. The human factors that may influence visual statistical inference were also investigated by @human2014. The experiments in @human2014 suggest that "individual skills vary substantially, but demographics do not have a huge effect on performance." Although there are some statistically significant factors such as "having a graduate degree" and "living country", the effects of these factors are minimal. These results demonstrate the robustness of the test against different human factors. Figure \ref{fig:lineup} is an example of the lineup. Which plot do you think is the most different? If you choose plot one, we are 95% confident to reject the no-relationship assumption between the two variables, "hp" and "disp" [@SIM18]. The lineup protocol can also be used for other types of testing by choosing different types of plot. For example, normality can be tested using QQ plot; the difference in mean can be tested using box plot; etc.

The question that arises today is whether we can train a computer to read residual plot and make relevant decisions, particularly with a computer vision approach such as deep learning. If this is feasible, we can have the deep learning model process a lot more data than a human can manage. Thus, the cost of rendering visual inference will become much lower.

```{r lineup, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Scatterplot lineup example: one plot is the data, the rest are generated from a null model assuming no relationship between the two variables. In this lineup it is easy to see that plot 1, which is the data plot, is different from the rest.", fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
lineup_data_mtcars <- lineup(null_permute("hp"), mtcars, pos = 1)
ggplot(lineup_data_mtcars, aes(disp, hp)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~ .sample)
```

The motivation for the task is provided in a blog post by Giora Simchoni [@SIM18]. He has designed a deep learning model to test the significance of the linear relationship between two variables for samples of size 50. The model reached over 93% accuracy on unseen test data. He also mentioned that the computer fails to pick up a strong non-linear relationship even though the Pearson'r is as high as -0.84 [@SIM18]. So the short conclusion is the computer vision is not perfect, in that it is not as flexible as human vision. As Simchoni explained in his article, the model can only distinguish linear relationship from no-relationship as trained. However, we think this fact is just another example reflecting the importance of visualization as we discussed above. A strong correlation does not necessarily mean a linear relationship. We should always refer to the plot before making any statement. What's more, if we want the model to be more flexible, we could simply adjust our design of training accordingly. Therefore, in this article, we are trying to further Simchoni's study. More specifically, we will build two computer models to perform two hypothesis tests as follows. 
The first hypothesis test is:

$H_0$: There are no relationships between the two variables.

$H_1$: There is a linear relationship between the two variables where all Gauss-Markov assumptions are met.

The second hypothesis test is:

$H_0$: There is a linear relationship between the two variables where all Gauss-Markov assumptions are met.

$H_1$: There is a linear relationship between the two variables where the variance of the error term is not a constant while all other Gauss-Markov assumptions are met.

For ease of exposition, only the regression model with one explanatory variable will be considered in this paper, but many of the results can be generalized to other cases including multiple regression model. Because the "statistics" we will use is the scatterplot, in terms of teaching the computer reading the plot, one variable is enough to generate different patterns in that plot for convnets to learn. And this makes the design process much simpler. 

The model we will use is the convolutional neural networks, also known as convnets, a type of deep-learning model "almost universally used in computer vision applications" [@DLR18]. The very first convolutional neural networks, called the "LeNet5" which was born in 1994, propelled the field of deep learning. However, this technique was in incubation from 1998 to 2010. In recent years, with the increasing data availability and more advanced technology, the design of the neural network architecture became more and more successful. Many types of neural network architectures have been developed since then, such as the "Dan Ciresan Net" which enabled the implementation of GPU for the first time, and the "AlexNet" which used the so-called "ReLU" function as the activation function and started a small revolution in the deep learning world, etc. [@cnn2017] Basically convolutional neural networks has two interesting properties: "the patterns they learn are translation invariant", and "they can learn spatial hierarchies of patterns" [@DLR18]. The first property implies that once the model learns how to recognize linear/heteroskedasticity patterns, it can detect those patterns regardless of their direction, thus handling negative/positive relationship automatically in our case. 

Unlike the classical programming where human input rules, in deep learning paradigm, we provide data and the answers associated with the data. Deep learning algorithm will output the rules, and these rules can then be used on new data to make predictions. To make our life easier, we can also think of the deep learning neural network as a complex nonlinear model which could estimate millions of parameters ($\textbf{w}$) with a big enough dataset. As usual regression problem, to get the estimates of unknown parameters ($\textbf{w}$), we need to provide the model with the dependent variable ($y_i$) and the independent variables ($\textbf{x}_i$). In this case, the independent variable will be the images of data plots (in forms of matrices) simulated from the null distribution and the alternative distribution, and dependent variable will be the labels of that plot indicating the true relationship of the original data. Once we have the estimated parameters ($\hat{\textbf{w}}$), we then can use them to classify unseen data plots, e.g. to perform a hypothesis test.

The architecture used in this study is a fundamental one. The estimation method for the deep-learning model is called "backpropagation" algorithm which is a way to train chains of parametric operations using gradient-descent optimization. The gradient-descent optimizer is meant to find the set of parameters such that the cost function reaches its minimum. The form of the cost functions or loss function is determined per each question. In both two experiments conducted in this paper, the deep learning model is expected to complete binary classification task, e.g. tell "linearly correlated" variables from "independent" variables for the first experiment, tell "heteroskedasticity errors" from "normal errors" for the second experiment. 
As introduced by @DLR18, "crossentropy is usually the best choice (as the loss function) when youâ€™re dealing with models that output probabilities". Originated from Information Theory, crossentropy is a quantity measuring the distance between probability distributions. In deep learning world, it measures the distance between the true distribution and the predictions. Therefore, in this paper, the binary crossentropy loss function will be used. The associated cost function is of the form,
$$J(\textbf{w})=- \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\left(  
\ y_i\ log\hat{y_i}+(1-y_i)\ log(1-\hat{y_i})  
\right)$$
where $\hat{y_i}  =  g(\textbf{w} \times \textbf{x}_i)  = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\textbf{w} \times \textbf{x}_i}}$ and $g(z)$ is the logistic function.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The main procedures involved in constructing and selecting a convnets model are shown in figure \ref{dgpc}. The convnets is trained on "train" and "validation" set. A certain number of iterations over all samples are done, the fitted convnets given by each iteration are saved, one best model is chosen as the representative for the computer according to the overall accuracy on the unseen "test" set.

The main procedures of the human evaluating lineup are given in figure \ref{dghm}. "Real data" and "null data" stand for datasets simulated under the alternative hypothesis and the null hypothesis respectively. More detailed procedures relating each hypothesis test are described in chapter 2 and chapter 3.

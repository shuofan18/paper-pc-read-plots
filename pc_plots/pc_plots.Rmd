abstract: |
  Residuals plots are a primary means to diagnose statistical models. It requires human evaluation to determine if the structure in the plot is consistent with a random variation or not. If not, then the diagnosis is that the model has not adequately captured the relationships between response and explanatory variable in the data. This thesis develops a computer vision model to read residual plots. It compares results with a large database of human evaluations. The evaluations were conducted using a protocol called the "lineup" which places residual plots in a formal framework for statistical hypothesis testing. The comparison between computer and human is made on a very restricted and controlled set of residual plot structures. A new small human subject study is also conducted to compare human vs. computer in reading heteroscedasticity.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

"The multiple regression model for cross-sectional data is still the most widely used vehicle for empirical analysis in economics and other social sciences" [@IE17]. Detecting possible violations of the Gauss-Markov assumptions is crucial to interpreting the data properly, especially in the early stage of analysis. There are several distribution tests that are commonly used, for instance, the Pearson correlation test for detecting linear relationship; the Breusch-Pagan test and White test for investigating heteroskedasticity. But primarily residual plots are the main diagnostic tool and these rely on human evaluation. Because data plots show a lot more information than a single statistic. A good example here would be Anscombe's Quartet. "It is a set of four distinct data sets each consisting of 11 (x,y) pairs where each dataset produces the same summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, and correlation) while producing vastly different plots" [@ANS73]. Matejka and Fitzmaurice also did an interesting study on this issue, they used 'datasaurus' data from @DS16 and generated a series of data with same statistics but very different plots as shown in figure \ref{fig:saurus}. [@JM17]

```{r saurus, fig.width=6, fig.height=7, fig.cap="Each dataset has the same summary statistics to two decimal places: (E(x)=54.26, E(y)=47.83, Pearsonâ€™s r=, sd(x)=16.76, sd(y)=26.93"}

  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  #theme(aspect.ratio = 1) +
  facet_wrap( ~ dataset, ncol = 3)
```

Steps of constructing computer experiment are discussed in section 2, Turk study (human evaluation) is explained. Section 3 compares computer performance against the database of human evaluation in reading linear relationship. Section 4 contains a short summary and some discussion regarding the future study.

Former studies have shown that human eyes are sensitive to the systematic patterns in data plots. With proper manipulation, visualized plots can be used as test statistics and perform a valid hypothesis test. One example of these protocols that provides inferential validity is called "lineup" which is introduced by @HW10. "The protocol consists of generating 19 null plots (could be other numbers), inserting the plot of the real data in a random location among the null plots and asking the human viewer to single out one of the 20 plots as most different from the others" [@HW10]. If the real plot is chosen, it means the real data is likely to be different from the null hypothesis, so we reject the null hypothesis with 5% chance to be wrong (Type I error). Because if all 20 plots are generated from the null distribution, the chance of one plot being picked is $1/20$ which is 5%. With the assistance of "lineup", we avoid falling into the trap of apophenia where we see patterns in random noise. This protocol has proved to be valid and powerful theoretically as well as practically through human experiments, especially when the assumptions for doing conventional tests are violated [@MM13]. The human factors that may influence visual statistical inference were also investigated by @human2014. The experiments in @human2014 suggest that "individual skills vary substantially, but demographics do not have a huge effect on performance." Although there are some statistically significant factors such as "having a graduate degree" and "living country", the effects of these factors are minimal. These results demonstrate the robustness of the test against different human factors. Figure \ref{fig:lineup} is an example of the lineup. Which plot do you think is the most different? If you choose plot one, we are 95% confident to reject the no-relationship assumption between the two variables, "hp" and "disp" [@SIM18]. The lineup protocol can also be used for other types of testing by choosing different types of plot. For example, normality can be tested using QQ plot; the difference in mean can be tested using box plot; etc.

The question that arises today is whether we can train a computer to read residual plot and make relevant decisions, particularly with a computer vision approach such as deep learning. If this is feasible, we can have the deep learning model process a lot more data than a human can manage. Thus, the cost of rendering visual inference will become much lower.

```{r lineup, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Scatterplot lineup example: one plot is the data, the rest are generated from a null model assuming no relationship between the two variables. In this lineup it is easy to see that plot 1, which is the data plot, is different from the rest.", fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
lineup_data_mtcars <- lineup(null_permute("hp"), mtcars, pos = 1)
ggplot(lineup_data_mtcars, aes(disp, hp)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~ .sample)
```

The motivation for the task is provided in a blog post by Giora Simchoni [@SIM18]. He has designed a deep learning model to test the significance of the linear relationship between two variables for samples of size 50. The model reached over 93% accuracy on unseen test data. He also mentioned that the computer fails to pick up a strong non-linear relationship even though the Pearson'r is as high as -0.84 [@SIM18]. So the short conclusion is the computer vision is not perfect, in that it is not as flexible as human vision. As Simchoni explained in his article, the model can only distinguish linear relationship from no-relationship as trained. However, we think this fact is just another example reflecting the importance of visualization as we discussed above. A strong correlation does not necessarily mean a linear relationship. We should always refer to the plot before making any statement. What's more, if we want the model to be more flexible, we could simply adjust our design of training accordingly. Therefore, in this article, we are trying to further Simchoni's study. More specifically, we will build a computer model to perform the hypothesis tests as follows. 
The hypothesis test is:

$H_0$: There are no relationships between the two variables.

$H_1$: There is a linear relationship between the two variables where all Gauss-Markov assumptions are met.
<!--
The second hypothesis test is:

$H_0$: There is a linear relationship between the two variables where all Gauss-Markov assumptions are met.

$H_1$: There is a linear relationship between the two variables where the variance of the error term is not a constant while all other Gauss-Markov assumptions are met.
-->
For ease of exposition, only the regression model with one explanatory variable will be considered in this paper, but many of the results can be generalized to other cases including multiple regression model. Because the "statistics" we will use is the scatterplot, in terms of teaching the computer reading the plot, one variable is enough to generate different patterns in that plot for the deep learning model to learn. And this makes the design process much simpler. 

The model we will use is the convolutional neural networks, also known as convnets, a type of deep-learning model "almost universally used in computer vision applications" [@DLR18]. The very first convolutional neural networks, called the "LeNet5" which was born in 1994, propelled the field of deep learning. However, this technique was in incubation from 1998 to 2010. In recent years, with the increasing data availability and more advanced technology, the design of the neural network architecture became more and more successful. Many types of neural network architectures have been developed since then, such as the "Dan Ciresan Net" which enabled the implementation of GPU for the first time, and the "AlexNet" which used the so-called "ReLU" function as the activation function and started a small revolution in the deep learning world, etc. [@cnn2017] Basically convolutional neural networks has two interesting properties: "the patterns they learn are translation invariant", and "they can learn spatial hierarchies of patterns" [@DLR18]. The first property implies that once the model learns how to recognize the linear patterns, it can detect these patterns regardless of their direction, thus handling negative/positive relationship automatically in our case. 

Unlike the classical programming where human input rules, in deep learning paradigm, we provide data and the answers associated with the data. Deep learning algorithm will output the rules, and these rules can then be used on new data to make predictions. To make our life easier, we can also think of the deep learning neural network as a complex nonlinear model which could estimate millions of parameters ($\textbf{w}$) with a big enough dataset. As usual regression problem, to get the estimates of unknown parameters ($\textbf{w}$), we need to provide the model with the dependent variable ($y_i$) and the independent variables ($\textbf{x}_i$). In this case, the independent variable will be the images of data plots (in forms of matrices) simulated from the null distribution and the alternative distribution, and dependent variable will be the labels of that plot indicating the true relationship of the original data. Once we have the estimated parameters ($\hat{\textbf{w}}$), we then can use them to classify unseen data plots, e.g. to perform a hypothesis test.

The architecture used in this study is a fundamental one. The estimation method for the deep-learning model is called "backpropagation" algorithm which is a way to train chains of parametric operations using gradient-descent optimization. The gradient-descent optimizer is meant to find the set of parameters such that the cost function reaches its minimum. The form of the cost functions or loss function is determined per each question. In both two experiments conducted in this paper, the deep learning model is expected to complete binary classification task, e.g. tell "linearly correlated" variables from "independent" variables for the first experiment, tell "heteroskedasticity errors" from "normal errors" for the second experiment. 
As introduced by @DLR18, "crossentropy is usually the best choice (as the loss function) when youâ€™re dealing with models that output probabilities". Originated from Information Theory, crossentropy is a quantity measuring the distance between probability distributions. In deep learning world, it measures the distance between the true distribution and the predictions. Therefore, in this paper, the binary crossentropy loss function will be used. The associated cost function is of the form,
$$J(\textbf{w})=- \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\left(  
\ y_i\ log\hat{y_i}+(1-y_i)\ log(1-\hat{y_i})  
\right)$$
where $\hat{y_i}  =  g(\textbf{w} \times \textbf{x}_i)  = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\textbf{w} \times \textbf{x}_i}}$ and $g(z)$ is the logistic function.

The main procedures involved in constructing and selecting a convnets model are shown in figure \ref{dgpc}. The convnets is trained on "train" and "validation" set. A certain number of iterations over all samples are done, the fitted convnets given by each iteration are saved, one best model is chosen as the representative for the computer according to the overall accuracy on the unseen "test" set.

The main procedures of the human evaluating lineup are given in figure \ref{dghm}. "Real data" and "null data" stand for datasets simulated under the alternative hypothesis and the null hypothesis respectively.

# Comparing computer performance against the database of human evaluation

A database of human evaluations of scatterplots is available from prior studies. This is used to compare the performance of the computer model. The computer model is trained on a broader parameter simulation framework and tested on the same data as the human evaluations. 

## Amazon Mechanical Turk study

\begin{figure*}[h]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=15cm]{figures/plot_turk2_300_350_12_3.png}}
\caption{One of 70 lineups used in experiment 2 Majumder et al (2012). Of the 65 people who examined the lineup,  63 selected the data plot, which is in position 20.}
\label{expt2}
\end{figure*}

A large database of results from human subjects was collected examine the performance of the lineup protocol relative to classical tests. The work is published in @MM13. This database forms the basis of the test set used to examine the computer model performance. 

In @MM13, "three experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the lineup protocol relative to the equivalent test statistic used in the regression setting." In each experiment, they simulated data from a controlled setting and then generated associated lineup for the human to evaluate. The human subjects were hired from Amazon Mechanical Turk where is a marketplace for work that requires human intelligence. [@amazon]

The controlled model in their first experiment is 
$$Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_{i1}+\beta_2 X_{i2}+\epsilon_i$$ where $\beta_0=5, \beta_1=15, X_1 \sim Poisson(\lambda=30), \epsilon_i\sim N(0,\sigma^2), i=1,2,...,n$, $\beta_2$ used in generating real data is specified in table 2.1. While in the null model $\beta_2=0$, and the null data was generated by simulating from $N(0,\hat{\sigma}^2)$. This experiment was aimed to test the ability of human on detecting the effect of $X_2$.

Their second experiment is very similar to the first one, but there is only one continuous variable $X_1$ on the right-hand side. It examined the performance of humans in recognising linear association between two variables, in direct comparison to conducting a $t$-test of $H_o: \beta_k=0$ vs $H_a: \beta_k\neq 0$ assessing the importance of including variable $k$ in the linear model. The actual data model is
$$Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_{i1}+\epsilon_i$$ where $\beta_0=6, X_1\sim N(0,1)$, and the null data was generated from $N(0, \hat{\sigma}^2)$.

The third experiment in their paper contains contaminated data where the actual data were in fact generated from two different specifications. 
$$Y_i=
  \begin{cases}
    \alpha+\beta X_i+\epsilon_i       & \quad X_i\sim N(0,1)\ \ i=1,...,n\\
    \lambda+\eta_i  & \quad X_i\sim N(\mu,1/3)\ \ i=1,...,n_c
  \end{cases}
$$ where $\epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma), \eta_i \sim N(0,\sigma/3), \ \mu=-1.75, \ \beta\in(0.1, 0.4, 0.75, 1.25, 1.5, 2.25)$. And $n=100, n_c=15, alpha=0, \lambda=10, \sigma=3.5$. The null plots were generated from $N(0,\hat{\sigma}^2)$.

Other parameters in the "actual" data sets of Turk experiment one and Turk experiment two are shown in table 2.1. In this study, we will mainly focus on their second experiment and use its database to form our first comparison experiment. This experiment 2 utilized 70 lineups of size 20 plot, with varying degrees of departure from the $H_o: \beta_k=0$. There were 351 evaluations by human subjects. These results will be used for comparison with the deep learning model. An example lineup question in Turk experiment 2 is shown in Figure \ref{expt2}. For this lineup, 63 of the 65 people who examined it selected the data plot (position 20) from the null plots. There is clear evidence that the data displayed in plot 20 is not from $H_o: \beta_k=0$.

```

## Linear relationship simulation

The design for our model under the alternative hypothesis in the first experiment is similar to what @SIM18 did in his blog. But the parameters are tailored to compare the computer performance with the Turk study results.

The model under the alternative is designed as:
$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i}  + \varepsilon_i, ~~i=1, \dots , n$$
And all the parameters in our model were designed to cover the range used in the second experiment in Turk study [@MM13]. Therefore, the relevant parameters in our model are generated using the following specification.

- $X \sim N[0,\ 1]$  
Distributions of X has an impact on the shape of the scatters. For instance, if X is generated from a uniform distribution, then the plots will look like a square when the sample size is large; while looking like a circle if X follows a normal distribution. 

- $\beta_0 = 0$  
Intercept is arbitrarily set to be zero because it has no impact on the patterns in the data plots.

- $\beta_1\sim U[-10, -0.1] \bigcup [0.1, 10]$  
$\beta_1$ is designed to be uniformly generated from -10 to 10 (excluding -0.1 to 0.1).

- $\varepsilon\sim N(0, \sigma^2) \ where\ \sigma \sim U[1,12]$  
$\varepsilon$ is designed to be uniformly distributed from 1 to 12.

- $n=U[50,500]$  
The sample sizes of each data set vary from 50 to 500 observations.

Figure \ref{fig:linear} shows four example plots generated using the specifications above. To facilitate the computer vision, all texts, ticks, and titles of X and Y axes are removed, so does the background grid. Under this controlled structure, a total number of 240,000 datasets are simulated. Figure \ref{fig:simplot} contains a histogram of the simulated n, a histogram of the simulated $\beta$, a histogram of the simulated $\sigma$, a histogram of the estimated sample p-value, a scatter plot of $\beta$ against n and a scatter plot of $\sigma$ against n. These plots show good coverage over the alternative parameter space.

grid.arrange(hist_n_l, hist_b_l, hist_s_l, hist_p_l, scap_beta_n, scap_sigma_n, ncol=2)
```

## Null plot simulation

This is the null scenario in our first experiment, eg. the two variables under tested are independent of each other. If the data arise from this situation, then the data plots will not show any systematic patterns theoretically. It is true that there must be some undesired patterns formed out of randomness, especially when the sample size is small. Unlike what Simchoni did in his post, no conventional tests will be used to sort out the "significant/insignificant" samples. Because the answer to the question that if the deep learning model can distinguish from patterns formed by chance and by nature is also interesting. The model is designed the same as the linear model:
$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i}  + \varepsilon_i, ~~i=1, \dots , n$$
with elements of the model generated using the same specification as the linear model, except  
- $\beta_1 = 0$  

e.g. the coefficient of $X_i$ is always zero. So $X$ and $Y$ are uncorrelated of each other.

Figure \ref{fig:norela} are four example plots generated using the specifications above. Same as the linear model simulation, a total number of 240,000 datasets are simulated under this structure. Figure \ref{fig:simp} contains a histogram of the simulated n, a histogram of the simulated $\sigma$, a histogram of the estimated sample p-value and a scatter plot of $\sigma$ against n. These plots show good coverage over the null parameter space. All simulated data and associated parameters including estimated sample p-values of t-test are saved and are used later on for calculating the performance of conventional t-test.

## Computer model

All convolutional neural network related work is done by the Keras [@keras] package in R [@R], which interfaces to the python software. The plots used for training and testing in this section is the scatterplot between the dependent variable Y and the independent variable X. It can also be considered as the residual plot of such data fitting to a constant model. The R package ggplot2 [@ggplot2] is used to generate the plots. All plots are resized to $150\times 150$ pixel and saved as png. This size is similar to the plot size used in the lineup for human evaluation. As for the labels given to each image, we use the true population as the samples' identification directly.

As mentioned above, 240,000 data sets are generated for each of the two groups in the first experiment. 100,000 of them are set apart for training. Another 40,000 of the data sets are set apart as the validation set in order to monitor during training the accuracy of the model on data it has never seen before. And the leftover (100,000 data sets) become the unseen test set. We make the test set so large that we can compare the performance of the convnet with the conventional t-test properly.

"A convnets takes as input tensors of shape (image height, image width, image channels)."[@DLR18] The channels are normally equal to three for RGB. In our case, the input tensors are of shape $150 \times 150 \times 1$. The channel is equal to one because the input data is grayscale images. Therefore, the convnet will be configured to process inputs of size (150, 150, 1). Weâ€™ll do this by passing the argument input_shape = c(150, 150, 1) to the first layer. The R codes below are used to build the convnets in R. From figure \ref{modelstruc}, the output shape changes after every layer of "conv" and "pooling" operations. The original $150 \times 150 \times 1$ image is finally sliced into a $7 \times 7 \times 128$ object (3D tensor). The figure \ref{diagconv} describes how "convolution" and "max pooling" operation works. By "convolution" the image matrix is multiplied by a filter, different filter gives different output matrix which extracting different features from the image. Max pooling select the max number within a certain area. Then we need to flatten these 3D tensor into 1D tensor so that they can be processed by the "sigmoid" function in the end. The "sigmoid" is, in fact, a special case of logistic function. $S(\textbf{x})=\frac{1}{1+e^{-\textbf{x}}}$. From this model structure, we can also see that a total number of 3,452,545 parameters need to be estimated, this is done by gradient descent. 10 epochs (1 epoch = 1 iteration over all samples) are done for training in our first experiment. The model specifications given by each epoch are saved, the one gives the overall highest accuracy is chosen to represent the computer.

\caption{Illustration of convolution and pooling steps on an image. The convolution step applies a fixed number of filters to sliding windows of $3\times 3$ cells. Pooling applies a statistic to distinct $2\times 2$ tiling of the image. In our model, the statistic used is the maximum of the four values. These transformations are the pre-processing steps done on every image in the training sample, to fit the model, and also to the validation and test images prior to prediction. }

The plot of the training history (figure \ref{histlinear}) shows high accuracy achieved in both train and validation set (93%-94%); slight overfitting starts from the fourth epoch; the variation of the values of accuracy and loss in validation set are very small after the fourth epoch. Hence, both our convnets and dataset are large enough and the training of our first experiment can be concluded. Then we select the fourth, sixth, eighth and the tenth model to have them tested on the unseen test set. And the results are shown in the table \ref{checkpoints}. In this table, the "$1-\alpha$" means the accuracy of each computer model tested on the "null data" in the test set only. $\alpha$ here is an analogy to the Type I error in the conventional hypothesis test. Similarly, the "power" is the accuracy of each computer model tested on the "linear data" in the test set only. The t-test performance in this table is calculated at 5% significance level. 

The 8th model is chosen according to the overall accuracy on the test set. We should note that since the majority of the data plots in Turk's experiment have been generated from linear relationships (when the alternative hypothesis is true), it is a disadvantage for the computer comparing in terms of being tested on the Turk's data. Because of the difference in $\alpha$ ($\alpha \approx 0.02$ for the 8th computer model) the 5% significant t-test and 5% human evaluations may have higher power than the computer model.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The performance of the computer model for the Turk study data is tested in three steps:

- Re-generate the 70 "real plots" using the same data in Turk study (without null plots);

- Create a separate test directory for the 70 "real plots" exclusively;

- The computer model's predicted accuracy over the 70 "real plots" is recorded as the model's performance.

The conclusion of human evaluation is obtained differently from the computers. Because human evaluated "lineup", not only the "real plots". The performance is tested in five steps:

- Count the total number of evaluations made by human for one lineup (N) and the number of correct answers for that lineup (k);

- Obtain N and k for all 70 lineups;

- Calculate p-value associated with each real plot using the formula introduced in section 2 of @MM13;

- Draw the conclusion: reject the null when the calculated p-value is smaller than $\alpha$.

- The accuracy of the conclusions the 70 real plots is presenting for the human performance.

For a fair competition, the Type I error ($\alpha$) should be held the same for all test methods. However, we do not have direct control over the $\alpha$ of the computer model. Because the $\alpha$ estimated from the computer model is close to 2%. Therefore, 2% significant t-test and 2% significant human conclusion are also included to give a complete picture of the comparison. The comparing result (table 2.3) is interesting. Human achieves the highest accuracy, and the conclusion from the human evaluation is robust to smaller p-values; 5% significant t-test is the second best, 2% significant t-test and the computer model give the same results.

## Aside discussion

Under the condition specified in this chapter, the conventional t-test is supposed to be the uniformly most powerful (UMP) test in terms of detecting the linear relationship according to the Neymanâ€“Pearson lemma. [@Neyman289] Although human achieved the best performance in the Turk experiment dataset, it does not mean computer does badly since the Turk experiment dataset only contains 70 plots. As we can see from table \ref{checkpoints}, t-test and convnets behave quite similarly on both the test data and Turk's experiment data. Given our test set is large enough (200,000 images totally), it is reasonable to assume that the convnets is, in fact, implementing the t-test or trying to approach the t-test. In other words, the best strategy the convnets learned, in this case, may turn out to be t-test. 

To check this idea, we calculated the accuracy of t-test again, with different $\alpha$ (from 0.005 to 0.1 with 0.005 increments) on all 200,000 test sets. The estimated power and overall accuracy were recorded. When $\alpha=0.015$, the overall accuracy reaches its maximum. This value approximately coincides with the $\alpha$ chosen by the convnets. And since the $\alpha$ of convnets is from 0.0142 to 0.0347 on the test set, we truncated the t-test data to create figure \ref{fig:ttdl}. The upper dots represent overall accuracy achieved by convnets (red) and t-test (green), while the lower dots stand for the estimated power in the test set. The smooth line overlaid aids the eye in seeing patterns. From this graph, we can see the convnets and t-test perform very similarly, while t-test has overall better performance.
